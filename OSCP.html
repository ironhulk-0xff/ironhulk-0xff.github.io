      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-blue-400 mb-2">What is OSCP?</h2>
      <p class="text-1xl text-gray-300 leading-relaxed text-justify">
        If you’ve been exploring the world of ethical hacking and penetration testing, you’ve probably come across the acronym OSCP. 
        It's more than just a certification—it's a rite of passage for many aspiring offensive security professionals. 
        But what exactly is OSCP? Who offers it, and what makes it so special? Let’s break it down.
      </p><br>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-blue-400 mb-2">Who is OffSec?</h2>
        <p class="text-1xl text-gray-300 leading-relaxed text-justify">
        OffSec, short for Offensive Security, is the company behind some of the most hardcore, hands-on security training in the industry.
        They’re the creators of Kali Linux, the popular penetration testing distribution used worldwide. OffSec isn’t just a training provider—they’re a mindset.
        Their motto, “Try Harder,” is infamous in the hacking community and sets the tone for everything they do. Their courses aren’t designed to spoon-feed you answers; 
        they’re built to challenge you, push your limits, and turn you into a real-world problem solver.
      </p><br>
  
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-blue-400 mb-2">What is OSCP (PEN-200)?</h2>
      <p class="text-1xl text-gray-300 leading-relaxed text-justify">
        OSCP stands for Offensive Security Certified Professional. It’s the flagship certification tied to the PEN-200 course, which focuses on penetration testing with Kali Linux.
        PEN-200 is a deep dive into the core skills every ethical hacker needs: reconnaissance, vulnerability identification, exploitation, privilege escalation, and post-exploitation—all bundled into a self-paced, hands-on curriculum.
        Think of it as a structured path to becoming a professional hacker. But don’t expect flashy videos or long lectures. You get lab machines to attack, a course manual, and a clear goal: learn by doing. 
        The content is dense, the labs are tough, and the learning curve is real. But that’s exactly what makes it so valuable.
      </p><br>
  
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-blue-400 mb-2">Who Is It For?</h2>
      <p class="text-base text-gray-300 leading-relaxed text-justify mb-4">
        OSCP is not an entry-level cert. While you don’t need to be a senior pentester to take it, you should have a solid understanding of basic networking, Linux, Windows, and scripting.
        If you’ve got some experience in cybersecurity, are comfortable on the command line, and you enjoy solving problems by breaking things, OSCP is a good fit.

        <span class="font-semibold">It’s especially ideal for:</span>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside ">
          <li>Aspiring penetration testers</li>
          <li>Red teamers in training</li>
          <li>Security engineers who want to move into offensive roles</li>
          <li>Anyone looking to prove they can hack it, literally and figuratively</li><br>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-blue-400 mb-2">What Will You Learn?</h2>
      <div class="text-base text-gray-300 leading-relaxed text-justify">
        <span class="font-semibold">The PEN-200 course is broken into modules that cover real-world topics like:</span>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside ">
          <li>Enumeration and scanning techniques</li>
          <li>Exploiting buffer overflows</li>
          <li>Tunneling, pivoting, and Active Directory attacks</li>
          <li>Custom exploit development (basic level)</li>
          <li>Post-exploitation tactics</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="text-base text-gray-300 leading-relaxed text-justify mb-4">
            You’re expected to think like an attacker. The course is loaded with vulnerable lab machines that simulate real-world networks. You’re given minimal guidance.
            You have to investigate, try, fail, research, and try again. That’s the OffSec way. By the time you're done, you'll be more than just technically proficient—you'll have the confidence to approach unknown systems with a hacker’s mindset.
        </p>
      </div>
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-blue-400 mb-2">What’s the Exam Like?</h2>
      <p class="text-1xl text-gray-300 leading-relaxed text-justify">
        The OSCP exam is legendary. You get 23 hours and 45 minutes to hack into a set of machines and gain administrative access (or "root" them). The exam environment includes multiple standalone machines and often an Active Directory lab.
        You need at least 70 out of 100 points to pass, and points are earned by compromising systems and submitting a detailed penetration test report afterward. This isn’t a multiple-choice test. This is you, alone in a lab, facing real machines with real vulnerabilities.
        You’ll be exhausted, frustrated, and possibly questioning your life choices around hour 16. But if you push through and pass, you’ll have something no textbook can give you: proof that you can perform under pressure in a simulated real-world attack scenario.
