        <p class="text-[15px] text-gray-300 leading-relaxed sm:text-justify pl-2">
            Active Directory is Microsoft’s directory service, a centralized, hierarchical database that records objects on a network and the relationships among them. Think of it as 
            the corporate phonebook, GPS, and security gate rolled into one. It stores identities (users, computers, printers and other resources), tracks where they live in the network, 
            and enforces who can do what. When you log on to a Windows domain, open a shared folder, or launch an app that checks your credentials, AD is the silent authority 
            confirming your identity and granting or denying access. At scale it becomes the backbone for authentication (Kerberos), authorization (group membership), and policy 
            enforcement across an enterprise. AD helps administrators manage permissions, enforce security policies, and organize network resources efficiently.

        <h2 class="text-[17px] font-bold text-blue-400">What is Forest:</h2>
        <p class="text-[15px] text-gray-300 leading-relaxed sm:text-justify pl-2">
            A forest is the top-level structure in Active Directory. Think of it as an umbrella that covers everything beneath it. A forest consists of one or more domains 
            (we’ll get to those next) that share a common schema, the rules for how data is stored and a global catalog, a searchable index of all objects in the forest. Forests are 
            isolated from one another for security, a user in one forest can’t access resources in another unless administrators explicitly set up trust relationship to trust.
            <br><strong>Example:</strong> A multinational hulk might have separate forests for its North American and European divisions to keep data and policies region-specific.
            <br><br>
            <p class="font-bold pl-2">Why we need trust:</p>
            <p class="text-[15px] text-gray-300 leading-relaxed sm:text-justify pl-2">
                Trusts exist so a security principal authenticated in one domain (or one forest) can be recognized in another without re-creating the account. A user in lab.hulk.corp
                can open a file share in sales.hulk.corp because the two domains “trust” one another: the file server believes the user’s Kerberos ticket even though it was issued 
                elsewhere.

        <h2 class="text-[17px] font-bold text-blue-400">What is Tree:</h2>
        <p class="text-[15px] text-gray-300 leading-relaxed sm:text-justify pl-2">
            A Tree is a collection of domains within a forest that share a contiguous namespace. In simpler terms, domains in a tree are related hierarchically, like branches growing 
            from a trunk. The first domain created in a tree is called the root domain, and any domains added beneath it become child domains.
            <br><strong>Example:</strong> If your root domain is hulk.corp, a child domain could be us.hulk.corp or eu.hulk.corp. All domains in this tree share the hulk.corp namespace.
        </p><br>
        <h2 class="text-[17px] font-bold text-blue-400">What is Domain:</h2>
        <p class="text-[15px] text-gray-300 leading-relaxed sm:text-justify pl-2">
            A Domain is a logical grouping of users, computers, and other resources within a forest. Domains act as administrative boundaries where policies and permissions are managed at 
            the domain level. Each domain has its own database of objects (users, groups, computers, etc.) and can be managed independently while still being part of the larger forest.
            <br><strong>Example:</strong> A corporate  might have separate domains for lab (lab.hulk.corp) and faculty (staff.hulk.corp), each with its own policies.
        </p><br>
        <h2 class="text-[17px] font-bold text-blue-400">What is Domain Controller:</h2>
        <p class="text-[15px] text-gray-300 leading-relaxed sm:text-justify pl-2">
            A Domain Controller is a server that runs Active Directory and manages authentication and authorization for the domain. It’s the "brain" of the domain, handling tasks like 
            user logins, password changes, and policy enforcement. If a DC goes down, users in that domain might not be able to log in or access resources until it’s restored. Key roles of a DC:
            <ol class="list-[upper-alpha] list-outside pl-8 text-gray-300 text-[15px] leading-relaxed sm:text-justify">
                <li>Authenticating users and computers.</li>
                <li>Enforcing security policies.</li>
                <li>Replicating changes to other DCs in the domain (for redundancy).</li>
            </ol>
        </p><br>
        <h2 class="text-[17px] font-bold text-blue-400">What is Organizational Unit (OU):</h2>
        <p class="text-[15px] text-gray-300 leading-relaxed sm:text-justify pl-2">
            An Organizational Unit (OU) is a container within a domain used to organize users, groups, computers, and other OUs. Imagine it as a folder on your computer, but for AD 
            objects. OUs make it easier to apply policies (like security settings) to specific groups of users or devices. For example, you might have separate OUs for HR, Finance, 
            and IT departments.
        </p><br>
        <h2 class="text-[17px] font-bold text-blue-400">What is Domain User:</h2>
        <p class="text-[15px] text-gray-300 leading-relaxed sm:text-justify pl-2">
            A domain user is an identity stored in AD that can log on to any computer joined to the domain subject to rights. Unlike a local user account, which lives in the Security 
            Accounts Manager (SAM) which only works on one computer, a domain user can log in to any computer joined to the domain, provided they have the right permissions. Domain 
            users are managed centrally by administrators, making it easier to control access across the network.
        </p><br>
        <h2 class="text-[17px] font-bold text-blue-400">What is Domain Computer:</h2>
        <p class="text-[15px] text-gray-300 leading-relaxed sm:text-justify pl-2">
            A domain computer account represents a workstation, laptop, or server that has been joined to AD Domain. The moment a machine joins the domain it gets its own secret password and 
            trusts the domain’s controllers to validate it, just like a user. Once joined, it can be managed centrally by administrators, who can enforce security policies, install software, 
            or configure settings remotely. Domain computers trust the domain controller (the server running AD) to authenticate users and devices.
        </p><br>
        <h2 class="text-[17px] font-bold text-blue-400">What is Groups (Computer and User):</h2>
        <p class="text-[15px] text-gray-300 leading-relaxed sm:text-justify pl-2">
            Groups in Active Directory are used to simplify management by organizing users or computers with similar needs. There are two main types:
            <ol class="list-[upper-alpha] list-outside pl-8 text-gray-300 text-[15px] leading-relaxed sm:text-justify">
                <li><strong>User Groups:</strong> Collections of user accounts. Assigning permissions to a group (instead of individual users) saves time. For example, an "HR_Team" group might have access to sensitive payroll files.</li>
                <li><strong>Computer Groups:</strong> Collections of computers. These are useful for applying policies or software installations to specific machines, like "All_Laptops" or "Server_Farm.".</li>
                <li><strong>Groups have scopes defining where they work:</strong></li>
                <ol class="list-disc list-outside pl-4 text-gray-300 text-[15px] leading-relaxed sm:text-justify">
                    <li><strong>Global:</strong> Members from own domain, usable forest-wide.</li>
                    <li><strong>Universal:</strong> Members from any domain, usable forest-wide.</li>
                    <li><strong>Domain Local:</strong> Members from any domain, usable forest-wide.</li>
                </ol>
            </ol>
        </p><br>
        <h2 class="text-[17px] font-bold text-blue-400">What is Policy:</h2>
        <p class="text-[15px] text-gray-300 leading-relaxed sm:text-justify pl-2">
            In AD, “policy” usually refers to Group Policy. A Group Policy Object is a bundle of settings like registry edits, security rules, scripts, scheduled tasks, software packages, 
            that you attach to sites, domains, or OUs. When a user logs on or a computer starts up, the client downloads applicable GPOs, merges them (with a well-defined precedence order), 
            and enforces the resulting configuration. Policies are the muscle behind AD’s centralized control: they standardize everything from screen-lock timeouts to enterprise-wide Wi-Fi 
            profiles, reducing drift and manual effort. When you open any Group Policy Object you’ll notice two grandes tabs: Computer Configuration and User Configuration. They 
            contain many of the same sub-nodes (Policies → Administrative Templates, Security Settings, Software Settings, Preferences) but they behave very differently because of who
            processes them and when they take effect.
            <br><br>
            <p class="font-bold pl-2">Computer-based policy:</p>
            <ol class="list-[upper-alpha] list-outside pl-8 text-gray-300 text-[15px] leading-relaxed sm:text-justify">
                <li>Processed by the operating system’s Local System account during boot, before anyone logs on.</li>
                <li>Scope is the machine object, identified by its computer account and SID.</li>
                <li>Persistence is machine-wide so once applied, settings live in HKLM, the file system, or service control manager and stay in force for every user who later signs on.</li>
                <li>If the policy/restriction lives in Computer Configuration, every account on that machine, even local Administrators, inherits it automatically at boot.</li>
            </ol><br>
            <p class="font-bold pl-2">User-based policy:</p>
            <ol class="list-[upper-alpha] list-outside pl-8 text-gray-300 text-[15px] leading-relaxed sm:text-justify">
                <li>Processed by the Winlogon process in the security context of the user immediately after successful Kerberos/NTLM logon.</li>
                <li>Scope is the user object, identified by the user’s SID; multiple users on the same PC can therefore receive entirely different settings.</li>
                <li>Persistence is per-profile: most settings land in HKCU, per-user portions of the registry, or the profile folder. They disappear when that user logs off and another user signs in.</li>
            </ol>
            <div class="boxed-inline">
                “Computer-Based" Group Policy always overrides user-based Group Policy. For example, if a computer policy blocks USB mass-storage devices, no flash 
                drive will mount on that machine even if a user policy later tries to allow them.
