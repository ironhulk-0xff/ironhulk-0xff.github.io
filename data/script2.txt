This space is where I share thoughts, tools, and techniques from my journey in cybersecurity.

Offense, defense, and everything in between — no fluff, just actionable insights based on real-world experience.
Whether you're just starting or deep in the game, there's something here for everyone. Certifications? OSCP, OSEP, ePTP, CISM, and more.

I’ve spent years breaking, building, and defending systems — now I’m here to share it all with you. If something here sparks your curiosity 
or raises a question, reach out — I’m always open to talk, troubleshoot, or tackle a challenge. Let’s keep learning, push boundaries, and make this space better together.

Yours
Iron Hulk
