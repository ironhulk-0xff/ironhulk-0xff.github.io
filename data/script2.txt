This space is where I share thoughts, tools, and techniques from my journey in cybersecurity.

Offense, defense, and everything in between â€” no fluff, just actionable insights based on real-world experience.
Whether you're just starting or deep in the game, there's something here for everyone. Certifications? OSCP, OSEP, ePTP, CISM, and more.

Iâ€™ve spent years breaking, building, and defending systems â€” now Iâ€™m here to share it all with you. If something here sparks your curiosity 
or raises a question, reach out â€” Iâ€™m always open to talk, troubleshoot, or tackle a challenge. Letâ€™s keep learning, push boundaries, and make this space better together.
